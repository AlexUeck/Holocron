# Definition
An **array** in software development is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type. Each element in the array is accessed using an index, which is a numerical value that represents the position of the element within the array.

**Key Features:**

- **Fixed size:** Arrays have a fixed size, which is determined when the array is created.
- **Indexed access:** Elements in an array are accessed using an index, making it easy to retrieve or modify specific elements.
- **Homogeneous elements:** All elements in an array must be of the same data type.


# Example/s


```python
# Create an array of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Access an element using its index
second_element = numbers[1]  # Value: 2
```
