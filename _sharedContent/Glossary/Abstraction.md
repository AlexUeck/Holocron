# Definition

**Abstraction** in software development is the act of creating a simplified representation of a complex system or concept. It allows us to manage complexity and focus on the essential aspects of the system without getting bogged down in the details.

**Benefits of Abstraction:**

- **Reduced complexity:** Hides unnecessary details and presents a simpler interface.
- **Modularity:** Breaks down a system into smaller, manageable components.
- **Reusability:** Allows components to be reused in different contexts.
- **Encapsulation:** Protects internal details from external access.
- **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to modify and update the system.
# Example/s

Consider a banking system:

- **Concrete Implementation:** The system stores account details in a complex data structure with various fields and methods.
- **Abstraction:** The system provides a simplified interface that allows users to interact with their accounts without worrying about the underlying implementation.
