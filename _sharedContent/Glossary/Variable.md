# Definition
In software development, a variable is a named location in memory that can store a value. Variables are used to store data that can change during the execution of a program.

Variables can be used to store any type of data, including numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays. Variables can also be used to store references to other objects.

Variables are an essential part of software development. They allow programmers to store data that can change during the execution of a program. Variables can also be used to pass data between different parts of a program.
