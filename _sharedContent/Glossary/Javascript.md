# Definition
**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used for both client-side and server-side development. It is a dynamic language, meaning that it allows for changes to the code during runtime.

**Key Features:**

- **Client-side scripting:** JavaScript can be embedded into HTML documents and executed by the web browser, making it ideal for creating interactive web pages.
- **Server-side scripting:** JavaScript can also be used on the server side with Node.js, which allows for building web applications and APIs.
- **Dynamic typing:** JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is not declared upfront and can change during execution.
- **Object-oriented:** JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of objects with properties and methods.
- **Cross-platform:** JavaScript can run on various platforms, including web browsers, mobile devices, and servers, making it a versatile language.

**Uses of JavaScript:**

- **Web development:** Creating interactive web pages, dynamic effects, and web applications.
- **Mobile development:** Developing hybrid and native mobile applications using frameworks like React Native and Ionic.
- **Server-side development:** Building web servers, RESTful APIs, and microservices using Node.js.
- **Desktop applications:** Creating desktop applications using frameworks like Electron.
- **Game development:** Developing 2D and 3D games using game engines like Phaser and Babylon.js.
