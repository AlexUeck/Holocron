# Definition

The top-down approach to software development starts with a high-level design and gradually breaks it down into smaller, more manageable modules. It follows a hierarchical structure, where the overall system is decomposed into subsystems, components, and so on.

**Steps:**

1. Define the overall system requirements and architecture.
2. Decompose the system into smaller, independent modules.
3. Repeat step 2 for each module until the desired level of detail is reached.
4. Implement and test each module individually.
5. Integrate the modules to form the complete system.

See [[Bottom Up Approach]]

# Example/s

Designing a software system to manage a library's data:

- **Top level:** Define the overall system requirements, such as managing books, patrons, and loans.
- **Decompose:** Break down the system into modules, such as a book management module, patron management module, and loan management module.
- **Further decomposition:** Decompose each module into smaller components, such as a book search component, book checkout component, etc.
