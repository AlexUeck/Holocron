# Definition

The XNOR logic gate, also known as the equivalence gate or exclusive NOR gate, is a digital logic gate that performs the logical XNOR operation. It has two inputs and one output. The XNOR operation is defined as the negation of the XOR operation, meaning that the output of an XNOR gate is true if and only if both of its inputs are the same.

**Function:**

The XNOR gate outputs the opposite of the XOR operation:

- If both inputs are the same (both 0 or both 1), the output is **1**.
- If the inputs are different (one 0 and one 1), the output is **0**.

**Truth Table:**

|Input A|Input B|Output (A XNOR B)|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|1|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|
