#logicgate 
# Definition

The XOR logic gate, also known as the exclusive OR gate, is a digital logic gate that performs the logical XOR operation. It has two inputs and one output. The XOR operation is defined as the logical disjunction of two inputs, meaning that the output of an XOR gate is true if and only if one of its inputs is true but not both.

**Function:**

The XOR gate outputs the result of the XOR operation:

- If both inputs are the same (both 0 or both 1), the output is **0**.
- If the inputs are different (one 0 and one 1), the output is **1**.

**Truth Table:**

| Input A | Input B | Output (A XOR B) |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 0       | 0       | 0                |
| 0       | 1       | 1                |
| 1       | 0       | 1                |
| 1       | 1       | 0                |
