# Definition

An AND gate is a logic gate that implements logical conjunction. It takes two or more input signals and produces an output signal that is 1 (true) only if all inputs are 1. Otherwise, the output is 0 (false).

**Truth Table:**

|Input A|Input B|Output|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|

**Symbol:**

The AND gate is represented by a symbol that resembles a multiplication sign (&) or a dot (Â·).

**Function:**

The AND gate performs the following logical operation:

`Output = Input A AND Input B`

This means that the output is 1 only when both inputs A and B are 1. Otherwise, the output is 0.

# Example/s

Consider a circuit that controls a light bulb. There are two switches, A and B, that can be used to turn the light on or off. An AND gate is used to connect the switches to the light bulb. The light will only turn on if both switches A and B are turned on.
