# Definition

An algorithm is a set of well-defined, step-by-step instructions that, when followed, will solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task. It provides a finite set of instructions that are unambiguous and lead to a desired output.

**Key Characteristics of Algorithms**

- **Finite:** Algorithms consist of a finite number of instructions that will eventually terminate.
- **Deterministic:** The same input always leads to the same output.
- **Unambiguous:** The instructions are clear and there is no ambiguity in their interpretation.
- **Effective:** The instructions can be executed efficiently within a reasonable amount of time and resources.

# Example/s

**1. Linear Search**

- **Problem:** Find an element in a list.
- **Algorithm:** Iterate through the list and check each element until the target element is found.

**2. Binary Search**

- **Problem:** Find an element in a sorted list.
- **Algorithm:** Divide the list in half repeatedly, checking if the target element is in the left or right half.

**3. Bubble Sort**

- **Problem:** Sort a list of numbers in ascending order.
- **Algorithm:** Repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are out of order.
