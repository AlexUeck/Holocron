| **Argument**                   | A value that is passed to a function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | "Hello World” in Serial.println(”Hello World”); | Algorithm Design - Modularisation                                  |
| **Array**                      | An array allows you to store a group of items (usually of the same data type) together in memory as a collection. An array is a ordered set.                                                                                                                                                                                 | "Student Scores", "Sensor Data"                 | Arrays, Data Structures                                            |
| **Loop Condition**             | The “test” to evaluate whether the loop should continue iterating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | while (x>5) <br><br>{<br><br>...<br><br>}       | Algorithm Design - Loops                                           |
