Write report detailing the installation of the server, specifically for the project requirements and goals. 



# Timesheet

Associated with the report, you will also create a timesheet spreadsheet to document the hours and cost to the client. This spreadsheet is to be embedded/linked into the Google Doc.

## Google Sheet
Start by creating the time sheet in google sheets. Create a blank document and enter the required values.

For example, your timesheet may end up looking like this:

Select the cells you wish to include in the report - using the example above, you would select all of them.

## Google Docs


In the existing report, add a section titled "Timesheet".

Paste the spreadsheet into the document.

The document is now updated with the 'live' link with the Google Sheet
