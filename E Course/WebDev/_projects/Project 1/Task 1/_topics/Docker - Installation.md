# Goal
Using your PC or laptop, or a school supplied one, install and configure a docker container for your future projects.

# Requirements

For this task, you will require a PC/laptop (not a chromebook).

Once the docker container is deployed to the LTC Server, the remainder of the content can be developed and written on a Chromebook (through the use of GitHub's Codespaces)

# Steps

If Docker isn't installed, install it here - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
