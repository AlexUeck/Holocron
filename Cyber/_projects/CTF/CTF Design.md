Using the information learned in the previous step: [[CTF Analysis]]

Design learning challenges to implement in this project.

Items to consider:

- What is the learning outcome/objective of the challenge
- What tools/software is required.
- What prior knowledge is required.
- How can the hardware (ESP32s) be incorporated into the challenge.

> [!note] This unit is called `Designing & Securing Enterprise Networks`. Therefore the challenges should have a focus on enterprise networking.

When brainstorming & designing the challenges use the following questions as a guide:

- What technologies does "enterprise networking" entail?
- How can these technologies be demonstrated in a controlled, locked-down environment?
