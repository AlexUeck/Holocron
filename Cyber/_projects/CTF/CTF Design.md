Using the information learned in the previous step: [[CTF Analysis]]

Design learning challenges to implement in this project.

Items to consider:

- What is the learning outcome/objective of the challenge
- What tools/software is required.
- What prior knowledge is required.
- How can the hardware (ESP32s) be incorporated into the challenge.
