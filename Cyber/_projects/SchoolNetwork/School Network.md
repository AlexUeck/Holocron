# Project Overview

This semester-long course introduces Year 11 students to the fundamentals of networking, including the OSI model, IP addressing, subnet masks, network topologies, and the use of the Packet Tracer simulation tool.

The networking topics you will learn are:
- OSI Model
- TCP/IP
	- Subnet Masks
- Packet Tracer

# Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the OSI model and its role in network communication.
- Configure basic network settings on their computers.
- Subnet IP addresses and apply subnet masks.
- Identify different network topologies.
- Use Packet Tracer to simulate and troubleshoot network configurations.


# Project Deliverables
